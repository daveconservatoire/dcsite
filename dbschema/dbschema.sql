In this groovy jazz number, the beats are arranged in to groups of five, which is why this piece is known as "Take Five".

(17, 'Soprano Sax', 'There are far too many pitches for most instruments to play.  Instead, we often see families of instruments that cover the range of pitches composers generally want to write in their music.

With so many sets of pipes to choose from the player can make a range of different sounds on the instrument, and can combine sounds to produce earth-shaking effects.

(23, 'Harpsichord', 'It is great to hear Bach''s music played on an instrument for which it was written.  Using the upper and lower keyboards, the player is able to produce louder and softer sounds, however, generally the music is all approximately the same volume level.  Music played on the harpsichord sounds crisp and clear and it really suits the intricate polyphony that composers were writing in this period.  ', 20, 'yOP7z54BXYo', 'ecomparone', 1),
(24, 'Piano', 'Here is the same piece, but this time played on a modern grand piano.  You will hear that the instrument sounds very different to the harpsichord, and in addition, the player is able to vary how loud and soft he is playing by touch alone.  This is a great performance as this player''s light and clear touch on the instrument reminds us of the harpsichord.  ', 20, 'fVUcPpMpuRg', 'fuzzy8balls', 1),
(25, 'Rachmaninov', 'This is a piece by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninov, written at the start of the Twentieth Century.

(26, 'Bill Evans', 'The piano hasn''t just been used in classical music.

(28, 'Viola', 'You''ll hear the viola is able to produce a much warmer, richer tone than the violin.  It is more suited to melodies that are slow and graceful not fast and energetic.', 15, '17lvqMdHyxQ', 'fanzowitz', 1),

(38, 'Brass Line Out', 'One thing that brass instruments can do is play loud!  And so when you have this many together in one place, you''re going to be in for an impressive show.

(39, 'Duet', 'Virtuoso Pianist Lang Lang and his father play a piece of traditional Chinese music called "Horse".  While Lang Lang is famous for being a piano soloist and playing concertos, he is playing the role accompanist in this performance.  He is listening very carefully to the sound of the Erhu to make sure that he isn''t playing too loud so we can''t hear it and allowing his father to play expressively.  You''ll see that the Erhu is capable of producing a wide range of sounds - even a few horse noises towards the end! ', 22, 'Lji834exsgg', 'rupertjones', 1),
(40, 'Trio', 'Here is the first movement of a piano trio written by the French composer Maurice Ravel.  The combination of piano, violin and cello is a very popular choice due the wide range of sounds and textures these instruments can produce.  You''ll notice here that the piano is not just left on the sidelines accompanying the solo instruments, but is also given moments to shine with its own melodies and solo passages. ', 22, 'dmjdKhn3YgM', 'hppiano1', 1),
(41, 'String Quartet', 'Here is the opening movement of Shostakovich''s Eighth String Quartet, it is probably the most famous he wrote.  It was composed on a trip to Dresden, Germany and might well have been inspired by the war-torn city the composer would have found.  The string quartet is very much a team effort with each player having important moments to play in the music.     ', 22, 'gSoKpCXWF0Q', 'opusoctopus', 1),
(42, 'Quintet', '. . . and add one more makes five!  Quintets are also popular with composers as it allows to blend instruments from different families together.

(43, 'Mars', 'There are so many fantastic pieces of music for orchestra, but Gustav Holst''s Planets Suite is one of my favourites.  Holst writes one movement representing each planet (except for Earth and Pluto, which hadn''t been discovered when this piece was written).  In these pieces you can hear a huge range of the different sounds an orchestra can make.  This is Mars, the Roman God of War, and you can hear a lot of military music here, with the march rhythms in the strings and percussion and the fanfares from the very large brass section.

(44, 'Venus', 'Venus is next on our trip through the planets (you may have noticed they do not come in the right order!)  I have a theory that it was this piece that inspired John Williams when he was writing the music to the film Star Wars.  Planets - Star Wars, it is quite easy to see the connection.  The haunting calm of the opening french horn solo is similar to that used by Williams for Han Solo''s theme.  If you''ve never seen Star Wars - go and see it!', 24, 'PyBkzZoMYN4', 'rupertjones', 1),
(45, 'Mercury', 'Mercury in Roman mythology was a winged messenger who would carry messages between the gods.  You can hear him flying about in the sky in the quick playing from the strings darting up and down at great speed', 24, 'CilfBWvCSXI', 'rupertjones', 1),

(47, 'Saturn', 'A very different character greets us as we reach Saturn on our trip through the solar system.   In Roman myths Saturn was a god associated with old age and death.

(48, 'Uranus', 'With Uranus we are dealing with a mysterious and unpredictable character.  Changing mood very quickly the music shifts from fast string passages to long ominous brass chords. ', 24, 'lGfwxpuY2jY', 'rupertjones', 1),

(50, 'The Frontman', 'Being the frontman of a rock group is about far more than just singing, keeping the audience engaged, communicating the meaning of the songs and making sure everyone has a great time are all very important, too.  Queen frontman Freddie Mercury was a master at all of this.  Here he is entertaining thousands at the London Live Aid concert in 1985.', 26, 'lDckgX3oU_w', 'oberon1966', 1),

(52, 'Playing together', 'The effect of a lead guitarist and bassist playing together is incredibly powerful and is used in a lot of heavier rock music.  Here is an example by the British rock group Led Zeppelin', 26, 'HQmmM_qwG4k', 'ledzeppelin', 1),
(53, 'The Power of Bass', 'Although in other styles of popular music the bassist plays a much more independent role.  This couldn''t be truer in funk music where the groovy rhythms of the bass player give the music its danceable feel.

This sonata was written by Mozart and is performed here by Chinese pianist Lang Lang.  This is Mozart''s Sonata in B flat Major K.333.

(58, 'Concerto - 2 ', 'This beautiful slow movement is one of Shostakovich''s most famous works, showing how sometimes the best music can be incredibly simple.

(59, 'Concerto - 3', 'Maxim Shostakovich must have been an excellent pianist as he performed this piece only a matter of days after his birthday.

(60, 'Symphony', 'Hope you''re sitting comfortably as we listen to a symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven, his seventh.  This is a long piece and it might be better to listen to it in small sections, rather than all the way through in one go.

(61, 'Barbershop', 'You can see why harmony has often been seen as music''s most magical component.  This style of singing is known as close harmony and is famed for its smooth and colourful use of harmony.  Blending four voices or instrument parts together is a central part of Western music.

(62, 'Campfire Guitar', 'Harmony doesn''t have to complex to be effective.  Many singers choose to provide their own harmony strumming away simple chords on the guitar. ', 47, 'a5amzHKp9x8', 'valw151', 1),
(63, 'Modern Harmony', 'Harmony occurs whenever a composer uses two different music sounds at the same time.  More modern music has attempted to move away from more standard chords to bringing sounds together in more unusual combinations. ', 47, 'KTGwFZxRRbU', 'musicxcomposers', 1),
(64, 'Worksong', 'While this worksong was recorded in the middle of the twentieth century, it gives us a good idea of the sounds we might have heard out in the plantation field.  Listen out for the call and response structure of the music. ', 34, '4G5KtQynWvc', 'abanks47', 1),
(65, 'Early Blues', 'This is blues guitarist and singer Blind Willie Johnson.  Keeping the call and response pattern from the worksong, these early blues players began to accompany themselves on other instruments, and most often the guitar. ', 34, '5hucTDV1Fvo', 'velotronic', 1),
(66, 'Jazz', 'While we know Louis Armstrong as the singer of popular songs like "What a Wonderful World", his trumpet playing technique and improvisation were very important during the development of Jazz.  The solo at the beginning of this piece "West End Blues" is almost like a cadenza, showing off his excellent technique and creative ideas.  ', 34, 'W232OsTAMo8', 'cretenick', 1),
(67, 'Bird', 'Charlie Parker (known as Bird) was one of the musicians responsible for pushing the limits of Jazz with increasingly complex harmonies and improvisation.  ', 34, 'S4mRaEzwTYo', 'minicqqper', 1),
(68, 'Rock & roll', 'During the 1940s and 1950s rock and roll music became incredibly popular with stars like Elvis Presley making use of television for the first time to get his music in to the living rooms of the United States.  Much simpler and to the point than the complex jazz of the time, young people found this music immensely exciting.  ', 34, 'Bm5HKlQ6nGM', 'yelserp22', 1),
(69, 'Rock ', 'Following on from the success of the rock and roll stars, record companies were always on the lookout for new artists and groups playing new styles.  British groups like the Rolling Stones, who combined the simplicity of rock and roll with the rough edge of the blues, produced some of the earliest examples of rock music.  The standard guitar, singer, drums and bass line up is still common in bands being formed today. ', 34, '8_VbImuG71M', 'imaStonesGirl1', 1),
(70, 'Baroque', 'This is a wonderful gem that comes to us from J. S. Bach, his concerto for two violins.  So how can we tell this piece comes from the Baroque period?  Firstly, we can see the harpsichord at the heart of the action.  More importantly though is the way the music is constructed, rather than one instrument that is the focus of attention, each part coming together to form the music.  This is the technique known as counterpoint and is a central feature of music from this period. ', 30, 'LIOh5Iq683o', 'OxD1Bn99CO', 1),
(71, 'Classical', 'Once we get to Mozart (1756-1791), music has clearly moved on from the Baroqie period.  Instead of the complex interweaving of melodies into counterpoint, most of the time in this music there is only one part which has the main melody, and the other instruments just play chords to accompany it.  You can hear this very clearly at the opening of this Divertimento, where the first violins play the melody, while the other strings play chords together.  ', 30, 'dPBL-kPQzkc', 'hamjii', 1),
(72, 'Early Romantic ', 'Attempting to broaden the scope and style of the music they were writing, composers in the Romantic period began to write pieces inspired by ideas, people, places and philosophies.  This piece known as "Fingal''s Cave" was written by Mendelssohn (1809-1847) after his trip to the Scottish Hebrides Islands.  It is like Mendelssohn is painting a picture for us of the dark and mysterious landscape of the Scottish Isles, with the sun occasionally breaking through in the lighter moments.  ', 30, 'TJHaIevlvac', 'thelightisahead', 1),
(73, 'Late Romantic ', 'As the nineteenth century continued, composers used bigger and bigger orchestras to power their ambitious ideas.  This piece by Richard Strauss attempts to tell the story of an attempt to climb an Alpine mountain.  At this point the climbers have reached the top as the music represents both the view they discover and the feeling of joy at having scaled the summit. ', 30, 'xK7z2NhUrsQ', 'berlinphil', 1),
(74, 'Atonality', 'As composers kept experimenting with music, some started to leave behind some of the established ideas about organising pitches and harmony that were established at the time.  The result was very different sounding music. ', 30, 'h0-4SZGCd_A', 'calkingjames', 1),
(75, 'Exploration', 'Another way composers could create new and exciting music was to start getting musicians to play their instruments in new or unusual ways.  This piece by American composer George Crumb also makes use of other objects to add other sounds to the music.  ', 30, 'm5a2RXA2Jn8', 'StanislavFilarmonica', 1),
(76, 'Electronics', 'The use of electronic instruments was not just resigned to rock and pop musicians.  Classical composers have also been very interested in the possibilities for new sounds this technology can provide.

(79, 'Bali', 'Comprising a wide range of different instruments, the gamelan being played is a sight to behold.  Hearing one at the Paris World''s fair is said to have had a great effect on the composer Claude Debussy, who incorporated sounds like these into his music. ', 36, 'ldPMifPbngc', 'ferretguru', 1),
(80, 'Australia ', 'Music plays a very central role in the lives aboriginal living across the Australian outback.

(81, 'Eastern and Southern Africa', 'This is the sound of the Mbira, which can be found across many parts of the African continent.  The music from the Mbira plays a central role in tribal community and is used for celebration and dancing, but also in religious ceremonies. ', 36, 'tIPORpN27CY', 'ytclassic', 1),
(82, '12 Bar Blues', 'The twelve bar blues is a chord scheme that has been used in music ranging from rock and pop to soul and jazz.  Known for fusing together the sounds of the blues with motown and gospel music, Ray Charles often uses this chord scheme in his music.  See if you can identify the points in the music where we return to beginning of the 12 bar pattern.  Here''s a clue - this happens for the first couple of times at 0:25 and 0:46.

(83, 'Jazz ', 'Here is a masterclass in improvisation given to us by saxophonist Sonny Rollins.  Sonny starts by playing the calypso "St. Thomas" tune, but is improvising from 0:39.  Initially some features of the tune can be heard, but very quickly Sonny is composing brand new melodies.  Keeping all of this together is the chord scheme of "St. Thomas" which is repeated unchanged throughout the piece.  The members of the band also get a chance to try their skill at improvising, and then finally, at 9:51 the band returns to the "St. Thomas" tune to complete the piece. ', 32, 'v4DTR0I7xhA', 'bluesbebopper2000', 1),
(84, 'Pop Song', 'While the Beatles may have come from England their music was inspired by the Blues, Soul and Rock and Roll musicians of the United States.  The form of this song - "I Wanna Hold Your Hand", unfolds as follows.  After a short introduction, verse 1 begins at 0:07, followed by the chorus at 0:23.  This is repeated with verse 2 (0:30) and a second chorus (0:44).  It was common in songs like this to add a new section towards the middle of the song to stop the verse and chorus structure becoming boring. This is a called a middle 8 and that''s what happens next from 0:52.  Next comes a third verse and chorus.  Then the middle 8 again.  The song is completed by a final verse and chorus.
