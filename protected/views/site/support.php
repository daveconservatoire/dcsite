<p>Music is so very important as it helps us to express ourselves, communicate with those around us and form friendships with others.  Perhaps, most importantly, along with other arts, music makes us human.  It is for everyone and will mean something different for everyone. </p>

<p>In spite of this, there are times when, for lots of reasons, people don't get access to the help they need to make music a part of their lives.  </p>

<h3 style="padding:10px 15px 15px 15px; "><em>I have massive plans for Dave Conservatoire.  Its main purpose is to ensure that no-one misses out on the excitement, joy and fun of learning about music, wherever they are or whatever their situation.</em></h3>  



<p>Regardless of whether someone wants to try a motivic analysis of Beethoven, learn to compose or just play their favourite songs on the guitar, I want to help them achieve those goals.  My plan is to cover as much as possible from music theory to performance, composition, improvisation, musical analysis and lots more.</p>

<p>Thanks to supportive feedback from <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="http://www.openculture.com" target="_blank">Open Culture</a>, <a href="http://www.rcm.ac.uk/" target="_blank">The Royal College of Music</a> and the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory" target="_blank">Music Theory group on Reddit</a> - I'm more confident than ever that I'm heading in the right direction to achieving some of these aims.</p>

<p>This is a very exciting prospect, but it is not something I'm going to be able to achieve on my own. </p>

<p>If you think I might be on to something here, have learned something or are excited about this project and would like to help; here's what you can do:</p>
